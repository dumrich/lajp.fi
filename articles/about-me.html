			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<p>I'm a young GNU/Linux-enthusiast from Finland who spends most of their time
			doing all kinds of cool stuff with computers.</p>
			<p>You can check out my projects from <a href="https://github.com/lajp">my GitHub page</a></p>
			<p>I've grown very fond of using products from the IBM/Lenovo ThinkPad -line. Currently I am a proud
			owner of two ThinkPad machines, those being the <a href="/articles/t440p">T440p</a> and the
			<a href="/articles/x200">X200</a>. Find more information about how I use my ThinkPads on their respective pages.</p>
			<h3>Programming</h3>
			<p>I spend a big part of my time programming. I mainly use C as my programming language, but I'm capable of programming in other languages as well.</p>
			<p>My most recent major programming project has been the developement of a text editor called <a href="https://github.com/dumrich/Ant">Ant</a> where the
			frontend is developed in rust and the editor-backend is developed by me in C.</p>
			<h3>Contacts</h3>
			<p>To get in touch with me, email me any time at <a href="mailto:lajp@lajp.fi">lajp@lajp.fi</a>. I do not use any kinds of social media on a daily basis
			which means that email is the best and most reliable way to reach me. I usually check my mail atleast once or twice a day.</p>
